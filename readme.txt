A prototype of Bayes-classifier based Mixed-algorithm Virtual-resources Scheduling System ,namely $BMVS^2$,was proposed in this paper,which designed a classfication 
mechanism for virtual resources request,aiming to give a best configuration of task's resources request under the virtual computing platform.

Although the hardware technology develops very quickly,compared to growing demand, resources are still limited, therefore the pursuit of Virtual Resources Scheduling 
System is to find a scheduling policy that maximize the meet to the needs of individual requests, and so that the assignments given are spatial and temporal optimal. 
In the $BMVS^2$ system, designing a prediction mechanism based on data mining classification technology to achieve division of category to tasks' requests,and get 
a better and more reasonable combination. In order to make a fast decision,an optimal classifier under the circumstance of full pattern-Bayes classifier is adopted.
For the adaptive characteristics, designing an evaluation factor, comparing the results to a decision-making process, thus the feedback will send to prediction and classification 
modules for exchanging storage-information, so that a better decision will be made in the next time.

$BMVS^2$ addresses the current systems' disadvantage of lacking of learning and adapting, making the system has the ability to describe the status information and to 
make a prediction,simultaneously,a reasonable scheduling of resources requests thereupon is achieved in a better way.Testing result show that virtual computing platforms 
are supported under the programme to make more flexible decisions.
